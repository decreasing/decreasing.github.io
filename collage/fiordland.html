                <h2>Fiordland National Park</h2><br>
                <p> is one of New Zealand’s treasured natural icons and is internationally recognised as part of the wider UNESCO World Heritage site, Te Wāhipounamu (Place of the Greenstone). It is home to glaciers, alpine ranges and unique flora and fauna that has been in existence since New Zealand was part of the supercontinent Gondwanaland.</p><br>

                <p>Fiordland National Park itself covers 1.2 million hectares of mountain, lake, fiord and rainforest environments and is administered by the Department of Conservation. Human activity within Fiordland has been limited because of its challenging and wild landscapes. Early Māori visited Fiordland for hunting, fishing and gathering takiwai  (a unique form of New Zealand jade or pounamu). Much later, European sealers and whalers took shelter in the fiords and built a handful of small settlements, these being New Zealand’s earliest European settlements. But overall the sheer steepness of the terrain, the incredible isolation, and the wettest climate in New Zealand deterred all but the hardiest from settling in the region.</p><br>

                <p>Fiordland National Park is known around the world for its breathtaking collection of fiords which ironically are mostly named as sounds. Interestingly, both terms are correct. Fiord is a geological term for an ice-carved landscape that has been inundated by water (usually the sea), and a sound is a geographical term for a large ocean inlet.  Cast your eye over a map of the South Island’s untamed western coastline and read out a roll call of names both in Maori and English - each with their own story to tell.  In order to convey the sense of majesty that the landscape provides the entire area was named Fiordland.</p><br>
