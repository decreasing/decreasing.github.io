                <h2>Zhangye Danxia National Geological Park</h2><br>
                <p> is in the eastern foothills of the Qilian Mountains in Gansu Province, China. The geological park has a spectacular Danxia (/dan-sshyaa/ 'red cloud') landform area that covers about 50 square kilometers (19 square miles).</p><br>
                <p>The danxia landforms are a masterpiece of nature. The colorful mountain ridges are just like an overturned palette from heaven.</p><br>
                <p>Zhangye's Danxia landscape has lots of precipitous red cliffs, most of which are several hundred meters high, and multicolored ridges of weathered strata, sometimes stretching to the horizon. These formations, sometimes smooth sometimes sharp, stand out against the greens or grays of the plains , looking grand and magnificent, vigorous and virile.</p><br>
                <p>About 540 million years ago, the area was once part of the ocean. Due to tectonic plate collision, the land folded and formed mountains, and lifted above sea level. Red sandstone was deposited when rivers formed in the area. When the ground sank into a basin, mudstone was deposited on the red sandstone. During different periods, varying sedimentary rocks were formed that contained different amounts of ferrous salt in the mud and stone. This is why the layers have different colors.</p><br>

                <p>Because of the changes in sedimentary environments, the sedimentary layers formed have different colors of red, purplish red, yellowish green, grayish green, and gray. Every layer took thousands of years to form. The movement of the Himalayas lifted the area higher and rivers formed. The river erosion formed gorges, and the early Danxia landscape was created. After further geological periods, river erosion and wind erosion formed the colorful layers we see today. This is the highlight that attracts visitors from all over the world. The colorful layers are how the Zhangye Danxia landform area became known as the "Rainbow Mountains".</p><br><br><br>

                <h2>How to Visit Zhangye Danxia Park</h2><br>

                    <p>The Danxia national park is located close to the city of Zhangye â€” about 30 minutes west by car, in northwestern China's Gansu Province. Alternatively, you can go to the city bus station first and travel to the park by bus.</p><br>
                    <p>The best way to travel to Zhangye is to go to Lanzhou first and then travel to Zhangye from Lanzhou, capital of Gansu Province, by air or by train.</p>
